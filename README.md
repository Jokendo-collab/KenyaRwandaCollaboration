## Project workplan
This is the repository for Kenya and Rwanda collaboration for COVID-19 project.
We shall do the following:
- [x] Sample download
- [x] Sample annotation
- [x] Individual country analysis
- [x] Squence alignment using muscle aligner: https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-113
- [x] Aliview program: https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/
- [x] We shall use BEAST analysis, from which we get an estimated substitution rate
- [x] BEAST Software - Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling: http://beast.community/

## Results
- Phylogenetic tree visualization

## Table. Estimate of the Mean Evolutionary Diversity for the Entire Population
The number of base substitutions per site from mean diversity calculations for the entire population was 87.46 shown  [1]. Standard error estimate(s) (76.68) are shown in the second column and were obtained by a bootstrap procedure (1000 replicates). Analyses were conducted using the Maximum Composite Likelihood model [2]. This analysis involved 99 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 30232 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [3]
